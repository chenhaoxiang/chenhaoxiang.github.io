----------

On Singles' Day, a supermarket has a promotional activity. Each customer will get a ticket on which there are two integers b and N, representing an integer M that only contains N digits 1 using b as the radix. And if the number M is a prime number, you will get a gift from the supermarket. 

Since there are so many customers, the supermarket manager needs your help. 

Input
There are multiple test cases. Each line has two integers b and N indicating the integer M, which might be very large. (2 <= b <= 16, 1 <= N <= 16) 

Output
If the customer can get a gift, output "YES", otherwise "NO". 

```
Sample Input
3 3
2 4
2 1
10 2

Sample Output
YES
NO
NO
YES
```

Hint
For the first sample, b=3, N=3, so M=(111)3, which is 13 in decimal. And since 13 is a prime number, the customer can get a gift, you should output "YES" on a line. 
题意很简单，就是求长度为n的b进制数在每一位都是1的情况下，是不是素数

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include<math.h>
int su(long long x);
int main()
{
    long long s,p;
    int n,m,i,j;
    while(~scanf("%d%d",&n,&m))
    {
        s=0;
        while(m--)
        {
            s=s+pow(n,m);
        }
            if(su(s)==1)
            {printf("YES\n");}
        else
            {printf("NO\n");}
    }
    return 0;
}
int su(long long x)
{
    long long i;
    if(x<2)return 0;
    for(i=2;i*i<=x;i++)
        {
            if(x%i==0)
              return 0;
        }
    return 1;
}

```
